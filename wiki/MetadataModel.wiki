This page is just capturing thoughts at this point

  # Taxon, Species, "Subject" identifier (links to ECAT?)
  # Resolution the data was captured to (what about multiple versions suitable for different resolutions?, intended use, fitness for use)
  # Accuracy of data
  # status (invasive, native etc)
  # Confidence of data? (both "this is based on my best guess" and calculated confidence in a model output)

  # Temporal (seasonal, and [need good term to describe] "changes over time", the time span this statement is valid for?)
  # Generator (human, machine?)
