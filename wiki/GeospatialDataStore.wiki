The geospatial data store in SDR consist of a PostGIS database. The database model is constructed with the purpose of keeping original sources and a common data model to access all of them.

The data on the model is introduced by using a set of scripts described in ManagingScripts. 

Check out the vocabularies section for lookup tables on the model.
