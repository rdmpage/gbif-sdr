= Introduction =
This is the API that is derived from the requirements

= API =
List of species occurring from a query with spatial, temporal (change over time, seasonal) components (presence only)
List of higher groups from a query (as above)
List of species with conflicting distribution (e.g. have layers that conflict)
Taxonomic query - where does this taxon live? (e.g. family...)
Browsing the SDR using a specific taxonomy (E.g. ITIS)
Spatial overview of biodiversity in area report - (endemic species etc)
Species richness
Using a reference list (e.g. IUCN red list) get those that meet filter parameters (spatial, temporal etc)

==OGC Services==
For biodiversity we have the problem that we have millions of species and thousands of datasets.
Ideally each of them become a separate layer in OGC services (WMS/WFS), which is not doable.

Each dataset could become a layer in oGC and clients will have to use a filter. This is not widely supported.
An open problem. What can be registered with INSPIRE???

=== Specific Layers===
For specific aggregated layers this is possible.
Potential candidates for layers relevant to be published in INSPIRE:
 * IUCN redlist species
 * species richness layer
   * specific by kingdom or orders/families
