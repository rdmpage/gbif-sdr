The Named Area Repository (NAR) is a datastore to keep geometries of areas that are used for describing species distributions. If a source specify that a certain species is present in Spain, NAR can be used to retrieve the geometry for Spain. There are multiple References imported into the Named Area Repository, like ISO2 Country Names, TDWG areas, etc.

There is an application to visualize the existing sources in NAR. Check it out to see what is existing [http://sdr.gbif.org/nar/ Named Area Repository Visualizer]
