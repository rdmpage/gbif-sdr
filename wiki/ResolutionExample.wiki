#An example of data loading at different resolutions
<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =
This is an example walkthrough of distribution data about a single species being loaded into the species distribution repository (SDR).
3 arbitrary resolutions have been selected for the sake of this example, but are not indicative of any fixed resolutions the SDR may adopt.
In this example, green indicates presence, and red indicates absence; no further metadata about the species or providers are given.

= Input data =

The following depicts 3 scenarios illustrating how data captured in 3 differing resolutions (LowRes, MedRes, HiRes) might be captured. These scenarios will be discussed with respect to the functionality of the API of the SDR.
