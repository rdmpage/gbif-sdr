== Integration of SDR with ECAT services  ==

SDR is heavily linked to the ECAT program. Distribution of species can be considered as direct part of the taxonomic information available on GBIF. Therefore all names inside SDR are taken and linked to the GBIF information back bone. That means that when a new species distribution resource is imported, first it has to get resolved through the ECAT services. This allows to mix the implicit taxonomy within the resource with the rest of species information within GBIF. For example, on SDR the Species Distributions from the different resources are displayed together with the primary data from the GBIF network, that means that we need to use a common taxonomic identifier for the name from the different resources in order to be able to present them together.

When SDR was first developed the new Global Names Architecture was still being heavily developed. SDR helped to shape some of those services with a first use case. Some of the tools created for SDR where created generic enough to make them reusable by ECAT.

The integration between SDR and ECAT is present in multiple places in SDR described following.
