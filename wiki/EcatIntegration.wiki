== Integration of SDR with ECAT services  ==

SDR is heavily linked to the ECAT program. Distribution of species can be considered as direct part of the taxonomic information available on GBIF. Therefore all names inside SDR are taken and linked to the GBIF information back bone. That means that when a new species distribution resource is imported, first it has to get resolved through the ECAT services. This allows to mix the implicit taxonomy within the resource with the rest of species information within GBIF. For example, on SDR the Species Distributions from the different resources are displayed together with the primary data from the GBIF network, that means that we need to use a common taxonomic identifier for the name from the different resources in order to be able to present them together.

When SDR was first developed the new Global Names Architecture was still being heavily developed. SDR helped to shape some of those services with a first use case. Some of the tools created for SDR where created generic enough to make them reusable by ECAT.

The integration between SDR and ECAT is present in multiple places in SDR described following.

== Resolving taxonomies prior to import new distributions ==

SDR imports data from multiple resources, but needs to present them in a coherent way. This presents the challenge of resolving multiple taxonomies and link it with the primary data from the GBIF network. To do this task SDR depends on the use of ECAT services to resolve taxonomies and provide the taxonomic information backbone.

At the end of the day, SDR only holds a NameUsage ID linked to the geospatial information of the species distribution. The ECAT services holds all the taxonomic information and SDR use those services to get any taxonomy information from it using the NameUsage ID. The process of obtaining this NameUsage ID at the import of data is what we call the taxonomy resolution. You can read more about the NameUsage IDs

In its most simple definition this process involves sending all names used in a species distribution resource (like the Red List) to the ECAT resolution service. The result of this resolution is the same names together with NameUsage IDs to be used within SDR.

Lets go trough it with an example. We will be using a resource called CANADENSYS. The data given by the resource is a
