=ECAT Taxonomy & Stable Identifiers =
ECAT manages 2 kind of closely related entities that are of interest to link to.
*Scientific Names* are collected in all different spellings and given a stable identifier, the *nameID*.
*Name Usages* are names used in some taxonomy or other publication. The combination of a registered checklist of names, i.e. the *resourceKey*, with a _nameID_ identifies a stable name usage.

ECAT generates a synthesised taxonomy that contains all known names, often referred to as the _"NUB"_ in GBIF.
If no resourceKey for a specific taxonomy is provided, the synthesized taxonomy is being used.

= ECAT Webservices=
all services respond in JSON if not said otherwise.

== Resolving Taxonomies ==
ECAT webservice that resolves non NUB name usages from other taxonomies present in ECAT to a list of NUB name usages. 

*Parameters*
 * *sn*: the full scientific name to be resolved
 * *k,o,f*: kingdom,order,family. Optional hierarchy parameters to better resolve names, especially homonyms
 * *res*: optional identifier for the resource registered in GBIF, so names can be best resolved

*Reponse*
 * list of ECAT NUB NameUsage ids

==Taxonomic Navigation==
for any checklist, not only the NUB.

===getChildren===
===getRoot===

==Taxonomic Search==

*Parameters*

 * *sn*: scientific name query string
 * *cn*: common name query string
 * *res*: optional checklist resourceKey to limit search to

*Reponse*
 * list of NameUsage identifiers + Namestring

*Parameters*
   * country
