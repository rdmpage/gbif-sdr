= Possible connections between SDR and the GBIF data portal =

 * Widget for display on species page to show the range maps available for them. 
 * Tile generated (same as per EOL) overlays are required only.
 * Consider continuing research on alpha shapes for extracting polygon data.
 * Setup a geospatial portal to hold "interesting biodiversity layers".  Species richness, endangered species etc: this could become an interesting way to present GBIF data to the world through a set of predefined layers registered on an OGC service.
