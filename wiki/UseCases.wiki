= Terminology =
 * Species Distribution: The (merged) distribution of a "species" as defined by an ECAT NUB Name Usage, i.e. not taking into account subjective synonyms, only lexical and nomenclatural groups.


= Use Cases =
*Note to authors:* Do not modify existing use case numbers as they are linked from elsewhere in the documentation

== Widgets ==

=== 1.0 Country ===
An owner of a country specific website may include a widget to visualise a single distribution of a species or higher taxon within the country.  The visualisation will show multiple polygons (or grids if appropriate) for each of the sources of data providing the information and will be zoomed to an appropriate scale for the country.  A legend will be displayed providing citation to the data source and links back to the species distribution repository website.  This use case is targeted at offering services to the participant nodes of GBIF.   An extension to this use case is to offer the same for arbitrary locations, and possibly limited to bounding box searches. 
TODO - add display of primary data
TODO - writable access will require redirtect to the SDR website
TODO - multilingual support

=== 1.1 Data source specific widget ===
giving something back to provider
Visualise single, global species distribution based on a single data source.
E.g. can be used for Fauna Europaea.

=== 1.1.1 Download ===
User can download in formats (Image, KML, GML, PDF, PNG, JPEG)

=== 1.2 Taxonomy specific... ===
Visualise all datasets for single species distributions.
Needs also to visualise merged distributions for higher taxa and proper taxa according to some, preferably multiple classifications (e.g. ITIS, EOL or the German National Flora using their synonymy)
Visualise single species distribution based on their own taxonomy.
TODO - add a note that the  configuration of the widget defines the taxonomy that is used - e.g. the user does not select it when using the widget

=== 1.3 Visualise output of Niche models ===
Modelers are generating predicted occurrence from the output of modeling using (for example) environmental niche models.  A widget will allow for visualising the model output together with data captured by hand.

== SDR Web site ==

=== 2.0 Home ===
The user can find information about the project,see general stats (number stored), 
TODO - multilingual support

=== 2.1 Browse ===
Using a sceintific name taxonomic browsing tool, the user can navigate to the taxonomy.  

=== 2.2 Searching ===
Users can search using scientific name or common name, datasets, 

=== 2.3 Registration ===
Users can search using scientific name or common name, datasets, 

=== 2.4 Log In ===
Users can search using scientific name or common name, datasets, 

=== 2.5 Making additions on the species pages ===
While seeing a specific visualisation for a species or a higher taxa, a user can log in, and be offered the ability to make modifications.  The user chooses to add a country, and is presented with the ability to select a country on the map.  A confirmation of "do you want to confirm sprecies X lives in this country?", user selects yes and the data is saved.
TODO - describe a mask    

=== 2.6 Making comments ===
User can supply free text comments on the distribution for a taxon.  

== Publishing data into the SDR ==

=== 3.0 User with collection of shapefiles ===

==== 3.0.1 Shapefiles are in an unknown format ====
The user contacts the helpdesk and negotiates the manual delivery of the shapefiles.  The metadata about this collection are authored, and a custom transformation of the data is done.  A load of these data are produced.  The scripts for the transformation and load of these data are stored and the same procedure can be run against the data repeatedly - e.g. should the input data be updated and a more up-to.date version is available.

==== 3.0.2 Shapefiles are in a format known to the SDR ====
The location (e.g. URL) of the shapefile collection is registered.  Metadata is authored about the collection and the shapefiles are harvested and loaded into the SDR.

=== 3.1 A spatial database owner with a collection of polygons ===
An export into the format described in 3.0.2 is recommended.

=== 3.2 A collection of primary data (e.g. GBIF portal index) ===
A clustering algorithm *might* allow the point data to be synthesised into polygons, or a raster or various rasters for differing resolutions can be generated.  Potentially this could be registered as a source and loaded in to the distribution repository.  

=== 3.3 A Darwin Core distribution extension with named areas is used with a Taxon Core  ===
The user will register this data through ECAT.
Named areas have to be existing in the Names Area Repository (NAR) beforehand and the supplied gbif:namedArea and gbif:namedAreaReference has to confirm to the IDs listed by the NAR.

=== 3.4 A gridded data source ===
A user has a raster format of data.  The user follows the same as use case 3.0, although the shape files are some format of raster file.  The resolution of the raster file can be declared.

=== 3.4.1 User has generated predicted distributed in a raster using e.g. a modeling approach ===
User registers this data and can indicate that it is machine generated.  The user can define the resolution that the data was generated, and can optionally link to metadata about the modeling approach.  An indication of the confidence can be supplied.

=== 3.5 Textual information (e.g. a paragraph about a single species) ===
Users publishing natural language texts/paragraphs about distributions of species. The texts need to be registered as darwin core archives with ECAT. The text is visualised together with a map on species pages, but not converted to spatial maps.

=== 3.6 Holder of presence and absence data ===
All above use cases can have presence and absence data, defined by the occurrence status

== Analysis ==

=== 4.0 Coverage of primary data ===
Allowing to determine % coverage of primary data with the distribution
Ability to discover gaps in the primary data

=== 4.1 Coverage statistics ===
User can find land coverage, ecosystem coverage etc for a species.  

=== 4.2 Publishing derived layers ===
Layers like endangered or invasive species, species richness etc are not linked to a single species.
Analysis to produce potentially interesting layers like:
 * country maps: only showing country areas
 * tdwg area maps: only showing country areas
 * species richness

== Web service users ==

=== 5.1 User can discover layer of interest from an OGC catalogue service ===
Publishing for example endangered species layer?
Invasive species?
Derived richness layer?
INSPIRE?

=== 5.2 List of species present ===
TODO - move this to a better group.  It is not a web service alone.  
At a certain point, polygon or bounding box, allowing for addition of certain additional filters (temporal, life stage sources, endangered species)
