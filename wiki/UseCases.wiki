==Input Formats==
  # GBIF occurrence store, point presence data]
  # ECAT mobilised DwC distribution extension (well known areas, such as "Atlantic ocean")
  # Polygon sources (generic shapefiles, GROMS etc)
  # Gridded data (e.g. raster based) 
  # Textual information (e.g. a paragraph about a single species)

==Output==
  # List of species occurring from a query with spatial, temporal (change over time, seasonal) components (presence only)
  # List of higher groups from a query (as above)
  # List of species with conflicting distribution (e.g. have layers that conflict)
  # Taxonomic query - where does this taxon live? (e.g. family...)
  # Browsing the SDR using a specific taxonomy (E.g. ITIS)
  # Spatial overview of biodiversity in area report - (endemic species etc)
  # Species richness
  # Using a reference list (e.g. IUCN red list) get those that meet filter parameters (spatial, temporal etc)
 

==Output formats==
