= Terminology =
 * Species Distribution: The (merged) distribution of a "species" as defined by an ECAT NUB Name Usage, i.e. not taking into account subjective synonyms, only lexical and nomenclatural groups.


= Use Cases =
== Widgets ==

=== Country ===
An owner of a country specific website may include a widget to visualise a single species distribution within the country.  The visualisation will show multiple polygons (or grids if appropriate) for each of the sources of data providing the information and will be zoomed to an appropriate scale for the country.  A legend will be displayed providing citation to the data source and links back to the species distribution repository website.  This use case is targeted at offering services to the participant nodes of GBIF.   An extension to this use case is to offer the same for arbitrary locations, and possibly limited to bounding box searches. 

=== Source ===
Visualise single, global species distribution based on a single data source.
E.g. can be used for Fauna Europaea.

=== GBIF Portal ===
Visualise all datasets for single species distributions.
Needs also to visualise merged distributions for higher taxa and proper taxa according to some, preferably multiple classifications (e.g. ITIS, EOL or the German National Flora using their synonymy)

===Project Integration, e.g. EOL===
Visualise single species distribution based on their own taxonomy.
====Implementation====
The project site will have to send 2 parameters: a) the unique species name or their local identifiers

== API ==


=== List of species occurring from a query with spatial, temporal (change over time, seasonal) components (presence only) ===

=== List of higher groups from a query (as above) ===
=== List of species with conflicting distribution (e.g. have layers that conflict) ===
=== Taxonomic query - where does this taxon live? (e.g. family...) ===
=== Browsing the SDR using a specific taxonomy (E.g. ITIS) ===
=== Spatial overview of biodiversity in area report - (endemic species etc) ===
=== Species richness===
=== Using a reference list (e.g. IUCN red list) get those that meet filter parameters (spatial, temporal etc)===
 

= Requirements =
==Input Formats==
  # GBIF occurrence store, point presence data]
  # ECAT mobilised DwC distribution extension (well known areas, such as "Atlantic ocean")
  # Polygon sources (generic shapefiles, GROMS etc)
  # Gridded data (e.g. raster based) 
  # Textual information (e.g. a paragraph about a single species)
