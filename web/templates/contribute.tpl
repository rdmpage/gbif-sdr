        	There are 2 ways you can contribute your species distribution data into the project.

        	1) Provide us with a set of shapefiles and metadata that we can manually import.
        	2) Export your data into the Darwin Core Extension for Species Distributions. This is normally transfer as CSV or XML files. You can decide to leave them on your server for us to harvest, or send them to us for hosting.
